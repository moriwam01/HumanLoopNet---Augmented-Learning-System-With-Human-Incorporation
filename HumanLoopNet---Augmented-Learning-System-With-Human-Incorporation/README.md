# Fashion Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying fashion products using machine learning techniques. It includes data analysis, model development, and a web application for user interaction.

## Project Structure

- `data_analysis/`: Contains scripts for dataset exploration and analysis.
- `model_development/`: Includes the main script for model evaluation and preprocessing functions.
- `human_in_the_loop/`: Implements techniques to incorporate human expertise into the model's predictions.
- `app/`: Includes the Flask web application and associated templates.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for initial data analysis and model development.
